Hello everyone, this is the beginning of my repository containing the notes for the U-Boot project. I will be updating it as I learn throughout the process.

# File Structure:
The current directory tree is as follows:
```
.
|__ Basics
|   |__ First\ few\ stages\ of\ a\ Bootloader.md
|   |__ Overview\ of\ U-Boot.md
|   |__ U-Boot\ build\ system\ and\ processes.md
|   \__ Environment\ Variables.md
```

# Licensing
Although I will be mostly storing my notes in this repository, I may also be writing some code. So the copy of the GNU General Public License v2.0 is here to refer to those pieces of code. (U-Boot is released under this license so I am obligated to do so as well.)

I don't believe that you can put a license on any knowledge that you may gain from this repository.
